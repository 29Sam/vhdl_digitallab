# electrical_core_sem3
this repo contains all the files concerned with my core electrical courses , dont know whether I should have backup for all or not , but yes shall be starting with digital lab course ee214  as I have mac and mostly will be practicing on the lab pc itself as Quartz installation is a big problem currently .
I hope however that someone look into  this installation problem soon.
